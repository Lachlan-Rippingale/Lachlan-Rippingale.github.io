						<div class="content">
							<p>My name is Lachlan Rippingale, my student number is s3795639, my Uni email is s3795639@student.rmit.edu.au, I’m 18 and I live in the Yarra Valley on the eastern side of Melbourne, Victoria. I’m half Australian and half New Zealander, originally my heritage is primarily Scottish. Currently finishing high school and these Uni subjects are to ease me into the Uni system. I only speak English at this moment but learning Japanese. My favourite sport is easily Basketball. I love watching Movies, Tv Series, Anime, Cartoon. I’m a big Dog lover and Chickens. Playing Video Games is also a big hobby of mine, met a lot of friends online so I’m very thankful for Video Games. One fact about myself that’s interesting would have to be me getting bitten by a tiger snake when I was 10. Most people ask me if it hurt but it felt like a chicken pecking at your skin. Luckily my family was home so they were able to bandage my leg up so the venom didn’t go through my body as fast, that’s what allowed me to live thankfully.
The hospital I went to was the Royal Children’s hospital via helicopter ride which sadly I didn’t remember.
 </p>
							<p>What is your interest in IT?</p>
							<p>My interest in I.T stems from the ever-changing future of technology and I want to be apart of that future.
								 I also like the opportunities for good jobs since the ranges of jobs for I.T work is expanding every year. </p>
								 <p>When did your interest in IT start?</p>
								 <p>I got interested in I.T from an early age with me always liking web games. From then I started to take my interest in I.T moreseriously with: building my first computer,
									  Making 2D computer games, Virtual Reality, Automative Technology, Assistive A.I, etc. Those are some of the interests/accomplishmentsthat I really love. </p>
								 <p>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</p>
								 <p>I couldn’t really say an event or person really sparked my interest or that I remember the event. But I would say me building my own computer was a pretty eye-opening experience
									  that made me think “Yea I can do that”.
									  If I was going to say a person it would probably have to be my dad, since he runs an I.T company our family has
										 always had like an affinity for computers, so I’ve always grown in an I.T family. </p>
								 <p>Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
								 <p>I’ve done work experience for a computer shop that specializes in Repairs on electronics (both hardware and software), building with hardware,
									  computer security out at different premises and doing building plan software for tradesman. Then there’s me tinkering around with HTML, Java,
										 and SQL. Those have really helped me grasp a lot more about coding and how things work “under the hood”.
</p>
								 <p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
								 <p>I chose to come to RMIT because it had the better online student satisfaction score. I did the Intro to Programming course and I really liked it so I thought why not do more courses on RMIT. So here I am doing Intro to Information Technology and hopefully more courses to come. </p>
								 <p>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </p>
								 <p>I expect to understand the fundamentals of I.T and getting a platform of knowledge to dive into many more courses since I’m currently
									  doing the path to Bachelor of Information Technology. Also, I hope to gain more experience in doing group assignments and how to be a
										 functioning member of agroup and how to interact better with people.</p>

								 <p>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. </p>
								 <p>This position is for IT consultants which are for people who are wanting to get a good starting job as an I.T consultant. Some of the things
									  you may encounter having to do in this job are data analytics, Project coordination, and business analysis. This job looks appealing at a glance
										 because it seems like a pro communication job which is good for networking, and they’re looking for people who want to learn and gain experience
										  to become better consultants. The attributes they want in a consultant role is great attitude, hunger for learning, ability to think on your toes
											 and take the necessary action, being able to work in group related projects.</p>
								 <p>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</p>
								 <p>Some of the skills that areessential for them are:</p>
								 <ul>
  <li>Strong interpersonal skills and being able to have professional relationships</li>

									<li>Use a blend of sales techniques which have a Relationship & Solution emphasis</li>
									<li>Are adept at the full sales life-cycle of prospecting, qualifying, initiating, analyzing, proposing, nurturing and closing </li>
								 </ul>
								 <p>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</p>
								 <p>The skills I currently have are:</p>
								 <ul>
								 	<li>Moderate Computer/I.T experience</li>
									<li>Strong (not overbearing) communication</li>
									<li>Problem Solver with both hardware and software problems related to computer systems</li>

									<li>Being in high stress situations and making a calm methodical move that’s best for the current situation</li>
									<li>Being flexible with helping people</li>
									<li>Attitude to learn as much as possible</li>
								 </ul>
								 <p>I have no qualifications at a uni level as the only course I’ve completed has been the Intro to Programming course by RMIT.</p>
								 <p>The experience that I’ve had over my life amount to:</p>
								 <ul>
								 	<li>Casual work for Computer/electronics store</li>
									<li>Vast knowledge for computer building</li>
									<li>Programming Java, SQL and HTML</li>
									<li>Being a leader for a camp of over 3,000 kids over 5 days, I had to lead a group of 50-60 kids per day through activities</li>
								 </ul>
								 <p>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. </p>
								 <p>To gain the skills I need to gain for the I.T sector I will be doing both uni courses and extracurricular learning for I.T systems as having
									  that extra learning will help me boost my experience and skills with multiple I.T systems. As stated above the qualifications I need I will
										 get from the uni subjects that I will continue to do. I wish to finish an I.T subject and eventually become an I.T consultant as one of my
										  first jobs and hopefully branch into other things that I become interested in. The experience I hope to gain to build on my current
											 experience would have to be gaining more knowledge and skills in multiple I.T systems/software. More experience that I would like to get
											  would be group communication and better more efficient communication with individual people. I think these will help me progress as a
												 person, work colleague, and group teammate.</p>
												 <h4>My Profile</h4>
								 <p>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.</p>
								 <p>I took my Myers-Briggs test from 16personalities.com</p>
								 <p>My results was ENFJ-T which from the website classed it as a Protagonist personality.
									  Description is “Charismatic and inspiring leaders, able to mesmerize their listeners.</p>
										<p>The results of an online learning style test. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Auditory: 30%</li>
											<li>Visual: 45%</li>
											<li>Tactile: 25%</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The results of the Big Five personality test is:</p>
										<img src="Lachlan-Rippingale.github.io/images/BigFive.PNG" alt="Simply Easy Learning" width="600"
	          height="300">
										<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
										<p>
												These results are interesting and exciting to look at especially to know what areas I can work on.
With the Myers-Briggs test, it shows that I have the personality of a leader and someone that can inspire people. I for the most part agree to this
 but the problem there is that sometimes I can self-doubt for own abilities, I really need to work on that and strengthen myself when it comes to my own
  abilities and believing in myself.
</p>
										<p>With the online learning style test, it shows that I am a visual learner. Which means I like to see what I am learning which is very true
											 but I also like to have auditory for when I’m running or moving around. I don’t think that I can only learn from visual since I have a
											  split but visually does make it easier but not the only way. </p>
										<p>With the Big Five Personality test I scored high on Extroversion and Agreeableness, with me being above average in Emotional Stability
											 and Conscientiousness. I don’t necessarily agree with Intellect/Imagination,I have been told that I flow with ideas and have an amazing
											  imagination and having the brain to actually execute the ideas. Other than that, very accurate testbut, I don’t know if it was just
												 that website would give me different stats to other websites</p>
										<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
										<p>With the results from the tests, I would say that I’m not someone that doesn’t clash a lot with other people but rather encourage
											 their thoughts and ideas. On the other hand that could work against the team as promoting bad thoughts and ideas could really hinder
											  the ability so I would have to find a balance with constructive yet encouraging criticism. I think a major part of my personality that
												 I have to account for is not being a pushover or trying to please everyone. It’s impossible to please everyone so I would have to strike
												  a balance with both sides. With me not being a pushover, I would need to stay firm with the ideas/thoughts that I have or being in
													 agreeance with someone else’s idea or thought that I am co-promoting to the group.</p>
										<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </p>
										<p>I would take my personality into account with making a team by, not getting a team of all “yes” people. That creates a problem with no real
											 work being done and basically it being a feel-good team, hard workers would be a must for the team as that would be great synergy between
											  myself and the hard workers. The people that I want for the group would have to be humble, leave all the ego and everything at the door
												 because that is not needed in the group. That would be a rough guide for making a team that would work coherently.</p>
												 <h3>Project Idea</h3>
										<p>Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.</p>
										<p>My project is going to be based on mental and physical health app, this would consist of multiple functions to improving both
											 mental and physical health. The mental health side would be revolved around how muchyou sleep, your diet, water intake,
											  taking part in your community, doing creative things and hobbies. The physical side would be keeping you active, being in nature,
												 going to the gym to relieve stress, section your days into a schedule to keep you focused. This app will be for the user to make sure
												  they are doing activities that are vital for average human health and also having optional activities to keep you in even better shape
													 mentally and physically. </p>
										<p>Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. </p>
										<p>This app will be very useful to make sure you are doing steps to keep you in good mental and physical shape.
											 That will help you in your work life with positives also being in personal life, family life and friendships. Surveys from the
											  Heart Foundationfrom 2015 show that 26.9% of males aged 18-25 are overweight and females from the same age range are only 17% overweight
												 (reference list at the bottom). Which is a major disparity that needs to be males aren’t being as active as much anymore because of
												  video games and watching TV being major culprits. Also, the major amounts of fast food people consume are definitely not helping. </p>
										<p>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service</p>
										<p>We will split the description into two, the two being mental and physical, Let’s start with mental.</p>
										<p>This app will hopefully help people that have depression issues, confidence issues and many other issues mentally.
											 Mental health is one of, if not the most important part of being the best you can be.</p>
										<p>When the app is downloaded, there will be some compulsory activities and then some optional activities that are there to help you even more.</p>
										<p>Mandatory activities:</p>
										<p>Tidy up your house, bed, bedroom, office space, desk space, etc</p>
										<p>Tidying up places where you live and work are shown to help you with clearing stress and taking your mind off problematic
											 things in your life. This will be the first mandatory activity I’ll have that will remind throughout the day about having your
											  living/working space clean. Also promotes good habits.</p>
										<p>Taking regular breaks from household chores and work</p>
										<p>Taking breaks from the jobs in life will help de-stress you, also gets you in a better mood that will make you do better in
											 whatever your job was before you left for a break.</p>
										<p>Nature walks while listening to chill/instrumental music</p>
										<p>Taking walks in nature will help your mind with basically everything and give you an appreciation of how good life is,
											 either walking through a park, national park, rainforest or some nice grass plains. The chill/instrumental music will
											  come with the app so you don’t need to download or find music that fits on what the app wants. The music will help with
												 de-stressing but also clear your mind and freeing your imagination.</p>
										<p>Water intake</p>
										<p>Water intake is vital for both mental and physical health. The app will alert every hour from 9am to 7pm to drink 200ml of water,
											 since 2 liters is the recommended amount of water intake per day.</p>
										<p>Optional Activities:</p>
										<p>Diet Control</p>
										<p>Diet Control is an optional activity since it will be very time consuming for the user to input all the data needed to get the correct
											 measurements. But if the user is willing to put the time into the Diet Control activity part of the app then it will help them
											  get back on track with the basics and if wanted, change the different types of diet to help them with what they want to accomplish
												 with the diet (diets for gaining more muscle, losing fat, etc)</p>
										<p>Now let’s look at the physical health side of the app.</p>
										<p>Sleep schedule</p>
										<p>Now having a sleep schedule helps both physical and mental health. Unless you are an overnight worker or you don’t work a normal 9-5 job,
											 the sleep schedule will ask you to hop off devices and 9:30 PM and be in bed by 10 PM. With the wake-up time being changeable but
											  the default will be 7 AM, that will give you a rough 9-hour sleep (depending on how long it takes for you to go to sleep) which
												 is the most optimal amount to sleep for adults.</p>
										<p>Going to gym</p>
										<p>I am putting this as a mandatory activity because I’ve seen the difference it has had on my life and my friend's life.
											 With this activity, I’ll have multiple workout routines (Cardio, Total Body, Weight Loss etc) this will account every type of person
											  who either does or doesn’t go to the gym on a regular basis.</p>
										<p>Coordinating your day</p>
										<p>This is another important part of your life is coordinating your day to make sure you get the most of the day. The app will have
											 a checklist sort of function so you can input the activities the app has and then add your own E.g.Work, Family time, Friend catch-ups
											  etc</p>
												<p>These are just some of the activities I would like for this app to have. Some people might say that it’s too restrictive or takes
													 control too much. But I think for life it is necessary to have a structure to everyday life and what better way to do that than on
													  an app. </p>
												<p>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or
other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
</p>
												<p>The software needed for this app would have to be an app maker like Java. Java is the easiest and most well used for android phones.
													 Swift is the coding language for making Apple apps then building the app with Xcode. The hardware that’s needed to make the app work
													  would only be the phone with the required version of the app. No more equipment is needed unless you want to go into heart rate and
														 other body levels. The app will only be available on phones and not tablets since with the current design tablets will not be
														  effective. </p>
												<p>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written,
													 and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</p>
												<p>The skills that are needed for this project would have to be people that have good amount of knowledge to make an app, for Android and Apple’s
													 respective app stores. The software that’s needed to build the Android version will be Java, as I stated above I’ll also have to use both Swift
													  or Objective C to code the app for Apple. The feasibility to find the skills and software needed I think is very viable since finding a coder
														 for apps now are a dime a dozen it’ll will take a little while to build the app and all the parts of it but when it’s done it won't need much
														  uptake and you can easily add new activities to the app.</p>
												<p>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
												<p>If the project is successful, the outcome would be monumental for health in general and would have an everlasting impact on the
													 betterment of lives. This app for me would help solve the issues of obesity, depression, anti-socialness and many other problems
													  that we see in our everyday lives that discourage us from being the best people we can be. The impact of this development like
														 I said above would reach basically everyone with the increasing issues of our society and it all starts at the roots of our day
														  and how we improve our health. Hopefully, this app will help people get out and be more apart of their community and help fix
															 some of the problems that this current day society has given us.</p>
